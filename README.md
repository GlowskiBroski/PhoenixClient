PhoenixClient is a new Minecraft Client developed for Fabric modloader for the latest versions of minecraft.
It uses mojang official mappings, not loom mappings. If you would like to build the project, there are no special plugins to do so.

The client began development on June 12th, 2024 and only has a few modules, but more are being added daily

Is the client safe? Yes. You are free to look through all of the code and assess for yourself :)

The client has 2 GUIs

1) The Module GUI. Modules can be enabled/disabled in this menu. (Default Keybind: RSHIFT)
